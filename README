ARRL Section DX Cluster Reporter Server\n";
Created by Tom Schaefer, NY4I with assistance from Bob Wanek, N2ESP\n";
Inspired by the quick multiplier checkers at W4GAC (SPARC) Contesters\n";
Copyright 2010 Better Software Solutions, Inc.\n";
This program makes use of the POE framework as well as Ham::Reference::QRZ\n";
Additionally, the CTY files from Jim Reisert, AD1C are used as well as \n";
 parts of the dxcc script by Fabian Kurz, DJ1YFK\n";
Copyright claims for external modules are retained by their respective owners\n";

To install, you have to make sure you have a few Perl modules:

You need to get Ham::Reference::QRZ and POE.

A simple CPAN or PPM (for ActiveState Perl) call should do the trick.

Note to have the most up to date CTY.DAT file, you should also go to this site ( http://www.country-files.com/cty/cty.dat ) and save the CTY.DAT file in the directory where you have the script.
